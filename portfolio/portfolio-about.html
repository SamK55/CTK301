			<p>Growing up in a rural small town smack dab in the middle of Illinois, there weren&#39;t that many musical experiences to be had. However, the advancements in smart-phone technology opened my world up to various different genres and music artists. Yet, my true love for music didn&#39;t truly come to me until I finally got my driver&#39;s license and could listen to whatever I wanted, blasting out loud on my car speakers.<img id="lizard" src="65880139726__6A14AEC2-8471-41F3-BA4A-DB33A17E881E.jpeg" alt="this is a picture of me holding a lizard as a kid">At school, I had hoped to flesh-out this newfound musical passion by joining the school band and chorus which taught me to both write, read, sing, and play music even if only in a more classical setting. By the time I reached college, I convinced myself that I should become a band teacher as well since my world view on music was still quite limited in terms of making a career. <img id="corn" src="IMG_2742.jpeg" alt="This is a picture of me holding a corn cob at a mid-west corn festival."> But thankfully, that&#39;s when I found out about the audio production and design major at my school that would allow me to broaden my horizons to incorporate the kind of music that I originally fell in love with (popular music) into my work and life. I had immediately caught on to all the intricacies of audio with its different principles in creativity, design, production, engineering, and performance of course. <img id="forrest" src="IMG_3082.jpeg" alt="This is a picture of me in the forrest where I proposed to my fiance.">  I hope to one day own/create my own studio to help other musician&#39;s while also working live sound for a venue in the Nashville Area. It's still so crazy how much progress a small town kid like me has made towards making my pipe dream career path into a reality. Plus, I still have  deep love for songwriting and performance so I hope to one day fully produce and release music of my own to show the world exactly of what I am capable of, simply because I love making and sharing my own art with those around me. So with that being said I hope you give me a chance by clicking on over to my gallery page to check out sound of the some of the work that I am proud to call mine!
